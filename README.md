## SAP Introduction

The SAP ERP system integrates all data and processes of an organization into a unified system.

**(Example on why SAP is needed)** Imagine that you are a customer and are to set up a small office and is in urgent need of 20 wooden chairs. Now the situation is under control if the desired quantity is available in the Inventory but what if you need something in bulk and it is not available. You will most probably not buy from this company and would opt for another brand that would fulfill your order on time. In this scenario, the customer loses time till the sales department actually comes up with the availability and this, in turn, degrades the brand name as you will return dissatisfied and disappointed. Even if you buy from them this time, you will definitely not buy from them in the future, let alone recommending them to someone. As a company, wouldn’t it be great for you to thus have a centralized system that would help different departments in maintaining relevant, updated and timely data thereby giving them an upper hand to focus on the product manufacturing, its quality and delivery rather than worrying about the availability and quantity.
